# FakeInstrument
Fake raw TCP based instrument to assist me with teaching other developers instrument automation with little to no previous experience doing so.

This was hastly written over the course of a single weekend so I expect it to have bugs and issues.  Some that I placed in intentionally (for educational purposes) and likely others yet known.  I do expect to expand on it somewhat in the unforseen future and to fix any bugs I didn't deliberately intend for.  I also hope to document the code alot better so at minimum my intentional bugs can be distinguished.
